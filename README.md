# Australian Road Fatalities Dashboard (In Progress)

This project is part of my **Data Analyst portfolio**, where I use **Power BI** to explore and visualize the **Australian Road Deaths Database** (1989 â€“ 2025).  
The aim is to demonstrate how data can be used to uncover **patterns, risks, and insights** that could support policymakers, researchers, and the public.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: [Australian Road Deaths Database â€“ BITRE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-b5f5d5cb-4fa1-4f5d-85f0-1d1cb7b8c6b7/details)  
- Contains information on:
  - Date, Year, Month, Day of Week  
  - State, Region, Remoteness  
  - Crash Type, Speed Limit, Road Type  
  - Road User, Gender, Age  
  - Indicators for Christmas/Easter periods

## Project Goals
The dashboard will aim to answer key questions:  
1. **Trends Over Time** â€“ Are fatalities increasing or decreasing over the years?  
2. **Geography** â€“ Which states and regions are most affected?  
3. **Crash Circumstances** â€“ What types of crashes and speed limits are most dangerous?  
4. **Demographics** â€“ Who is most at risk (age, gender, road user)?  
5. **Special Periods** â€“ Do fatalities spike during holidays like Christmas and Easter?

## ðŸ“Š Planned Dashboard Layout
- **KPI Cards**: Total fatalities, average per year, peak year  
- **Trends**: Fatalities per Month-Year, by Day of Week  
- **Geography**: Fatalities by State (map view)  
- **Crash Circumstances**: By Crash Type, by Speed Limit  
- **Demographics**: By Road User, Age Group, Gender  
- **Special Periods**: Holiday vs non-holiday comparisons

## Status
- [x] Dataset downloaded and reviewed  
- [ ] Data cleaning & transformations in Power Query  
- [ ] First visuals (Trends, Map, Road User)  
- [ ] Complete interactive dashboard  
- [ ] Publish screenshots + walkthrough  

---

## Notes
This is an **in-progress project**.  
Iâ€™m currently building the first set of visuals in Power BI, and will update this repository with:
- Screenshots of the dashboard  
- A walkthrough report of insights  

Stay tuned for updates!
